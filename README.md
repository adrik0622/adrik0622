Hello, my account name is adrik0622,
I'm a junior system administrator, this is just where the majority of my applications and scripts are going to go.
Currently going to school for a double major in Computer engineering and computer science.
I'm willing to collaborate on anything open source to do with machine learning, natural language processing, video games, modding, cybersecurity, Operating Systems, Malware and exploits. I will not participate in any project that is intended to be used in a harmful way.
